<h1>Texas Hold'Em Rules</h1>

<p>When playing Texas Hold'Em poker, every player is dealt two cards face down – these are called your 'hole cards'. <br />
    Then there is a round of betting where you can Check, Bet or Fold. This stage of the game is known as pre-flop and what you should do is dependent on those hole cards, or starting hand. <br />
    When all the betting has finished three shared cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. This is called the flop. <br />
    After this there is another round of betting, then a fourth shared card – called the turn – is dealt. <br />
    There is another round of betting then a final shared card – called the river – and a final round of betting.<br />
    Your best Texas Holdem hands will be made by using your hole cards and the five cards in the middle to make the best possible five card poker hand, as seen below. <br /><br /></p>

<p>There are two ways a hand can end.<br />
    One is when the players in a hand turn over their hole cards and the player with the best hand wins. This is known as a showdown.<br />
    The other is that someone will bet enough that everyone else folds. <br />
    This is how most hands end in Texas Hold'em – you don't always need the best hand to win! <br /><br /></p>

<p>Before cards are dealt, the two players to the left of the dealer are forced to post blinds, or forced bets.<br />
    There are small blinds and big blinds, and any players wishing to stay in the hand must match the big blind.  <br />
    Starting from the player to the left of the Big blind, players take turns raising, calling, or folding.<br />
    Play continues until the last player to bet or raise (or first player to call if there are no bets) turn returns.<br />
    For further rounds of betting, the player to the left of the dealer is the first to act, and may bet, check, or fold.<br />
    Play continues around again until the last player to bet or raise would have another turn (or first to act with no bets).<br />
    If there are only two players, the dealer will be the small blind and the other player the big blind.</p>

        <p>In the event of a tie, higher values win.  If both players have the same hand, higher kicker card is the next tiebreaker.  <br />
        If there is no possible tiebreaker, all players with the winning hand split the pot.</p>
